## Installation

Put this `docker-compose.yml` to the parent folder where all the other projects (`gateway`, `client`, `backend`, `chat`, `eureka`) exist. 

## To up all the services

> `sudo docker-compose up --build`

## To down all the services

> `sudo docker-compose down`

## Other Configurations

In `docker-compose-2.yml`, I have configured the backend service to be replicated with 2 replicas.
